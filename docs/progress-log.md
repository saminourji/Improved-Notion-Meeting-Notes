# Progress Log – Improved Notion Meeting Notes Prototype

_This is a living document intended to be updated alongside development. Use it to capture newly discovered tasks, track progress, and record feedback-driven changes._

## Usage Guidelines
- Update this document whenever a task is started, completed, or reprioritized.
- Capture notable feedback from demo reviewers and translate it into actionable items below.
- Link to relevant commits, pull requests, or logs when available.

## Snapshot Status
- **Overall State:** Core pipeline implemented and tested
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 – Backend Pipeline (core functionality complete)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-23

## Active Action Items
- [x] Finalize recommended speech/LLM tech stack selections based on current research
- [x] Define backend project structure, environment setup, and configuration strategy
- [x] Implement core diarization pipeline using pyannote.audio
- [x] Create speaker embedding generation and matching workflow
- [x] Integrate transcription service using faster-whisper
- [x] Build file upload API endpoint for meeting processing
- [x] Create CLI test script for pipeline validation
- [x] Add LLM integration for summaries and persona-specific action items
- [x] Implement speaker-specific action item views (n+1 views: general + per-speaker personalized)
- [ ] Test with provided audio samples and optimize accuracy
- [ ] Create frontend integration layer

## Completed Work
- **Phase 1**: Core audio processing pipeline with diarization, speaker matching, and transcription
- **Phase 2**: LLM integration with OpenAI for intelligent meeting analysis
  - Meeting summary generation from speaker-annotated transcripts
  - Action items extraction with speaker assignment
  - Speaker-specific action item views (n+1 personalized views)
  - Comprehensive insights combining summaries and action items
- Direct file upload API endpoint (`POST /process`) with multipart form support
- Multiple LLM API endpoints (`/summarize`, `/action-items`, `/insights`)
- CLI testing script for validating pipeline components
- Environment-based configuration for API keys and tokens
- 100% speaker identification rate achieved in testing

## Blockers & Risks
- Verify OpenAI usage costs and rate limits against expected demo traffic.
- Potential compute constraints for diarization/transcription on chosen hosting provider.

## Feedback & Notes
- _Placeholder for insights from demo runs, Notion engineers, or user testing._

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Adopted stack documented in `docs/technical-stack.md` (pyannote.audio + faster-whisper + OpenAI API).
- TODO: Document setup instructions for Hugging Face token, FFmpeg, and OpenAI API keys in README.
- TODO: Build CLI smoke test to validate pipeline once scaffolding is ready.

## Speaker-Specific Action Items Feature Requirements
- **1 Universal Summary**: Same meeting summary for all users
- **1 General Action Items View**: Complete list of all tasks for all speakers
- **N Speaker-Specific Views**: Personalized action items for each meeting participant
- **UI Behavior**:
  - "Your action items" when viewing user is a meeting participant
  - "Action Items" when viewing user was not in the meeting
- **Technical Implementation**: n+1 API calls with different prompts/filters

## Next Steps & Remaining Work

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration**
- **Frontend UI Development**: Build interface for meeting upload and results display
- **Speaker-Specific View Logic**: Implement "Your action items" vs "Action Items" UI switching
- **Results Display**: Show summary + appropriate action items view based on user
- **User Authentication**: Identify if viewing user was meeting participant
- **Meeting Management**: Upload, process, store, and retrieve meeting results

### **Phase 4: Production Optimization**
- **Performance**: Optimize LLM token usage and API response times
- **Scaling**: Handle multiple concurrent meeting processing requests
- **Cost Management**: Monitor and optimize OpenAI API usage costs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints and data handling

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features**
- **Meeting Analytics**: Trends, patterns, and insights across meetings
- **Integration**: Connect with existing Notion workspaces
- **Advanced AI**: More sophisticated action item tracking and follow-ups
- **Multi-format Support**: Video, different audio formats, real-time processing

## Current Status: Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅
**Ready for Demo**: Complete meeting processing pipeline with AI insights and speaker-specific views
