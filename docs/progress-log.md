# Progress Log – Improved Notion Meeting Notes Prototype

_This is a living document intended to be updated alongside development. Use it to capture newly discovered tasks, track progress, and record feedback-driven changes._

## Usage Guidelines
- Update this document whenever a task is started, completed, or reprioritized.
- Capture notable feedback from demo reviewers and translate it into actionable items below.
- Link to relevant commits, pull requests, or logs when available.

## Snapshot Status
- **Overall State:** Core pipeline implemented and tested
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 – Backend Pipeline (core functionality complete)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-23

## Active Action Items
- [x] Finalize recommended speech/LLM tech stack selections based on current research
- [x] Define backend project structure, environment setup, and configuration strategy
- [x] Implement core diarization pipeline using pyannote.audio
- [x] Create speaker embedding generation and matching workflow
- [x] Integrate transcription service using faster-whisper
- [x] Build file upload API endpoint for meeting processing
- [x] Create CLI test script for pipeline validation
- [ ] Add LLM integration for summaries and persona-specific action items
- [ ] Test with provided audio samples and optimize accuracy
- [ ] Create frontend integration layer

## Completed Work
- Core audio processing pipeline with diarization, speaker matching, and transcription
- Direct file upload API endpoint (`POST /process`) with multipart form support
- CLI testing script for validating pipeline components
- Environment-based configuration for API keys and tokens

## Blockers & Risks
- Verify OpenAI usage costs and rate limits against expected demo traffic.
- Potential compute constraints for diarization/transcription on chosen hosting provider.

## Feedback & Notes
- _Placeholder for insights from demo runs, Notion engineers, or user testing._

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Adopted stack documented in `docs/technical-stack.md` (pyannote.audio + faster-whisper + OpenAI API).
- TODO: Document setup instructions for Hugging Face token, FFmpeg, and OpenAI API keys in README.
- TODO: Build CLI smoke test to validate pipeline once scaffolding is ready.

## Upcoming Milestones
- Phase 1 kickoff: backend scaffolding ready for initial pipeline tests
- Phase 2 readiness: REST APIs proven with sample data and documented for frontend handoff
