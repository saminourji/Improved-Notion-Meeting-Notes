## Completed Work
- **Phase 1**: Core audio processing pipeline with diarization, speaker matching, and transcription
- **Phase 2**: LLM integration with OpenAI for intelligent meeting analysis
  - Meeting summary generation from speaker-annotated transcripts
  - Action items extraction with speaker assignment
  - Speaker-specific action item views (n+1 personalized views)
  - Comprehensive insights combining summaries and action items
- **Phase 3**: Complete frontend interface with React + TypeScript
  - Two-section layout: Speaker setup (top) + Notion-like interface (bottom)
  - Speaker management with voice sample recording/upload using MediaRecorder API
  - Meeting recording and file upload with real-time audio visualization
  - Markdown-rendered summaries with interactive action item checkboxes
  - Searchable transcript display with speaker identification
  - Session storage for persistence and auto-save functionality
  - Complete API integration with comprehensive error handling
- Direct file upload API endpoint (`POST /process`) with multipart form support
- Multiple LLM API endpoints (`/summarize`, `/action-items`, `/insights`)
- CLI testing script for validating pipeline components
- Environment-based configuration for API keys and tokens
- 100% speaker identification rate achieved in testing

## Blockers & Risks
- Verify OpenAI usage costs and rate limits against expected demo traffic.
- Potential compute constraints for diarization/transcription on chosen hosting provider.

## Feedback & Notes
- _Placeholder for insights from demo runs, Notion engineers, or user testing._

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Adopted stack documented in `docs/technical-stack.md` (pyannote.audio + faster-whisper + OpenAI API).
- TODO: Document setup instructions for Hugging Face token, FFmpeg, and OpenAI API keys in README.
- TODO: Build CLI smoke test to validate pipeline once scaffolding is ready.

## Speaker-Specific Action Items Feature Requirements
- **1 Universal Summary**: Same meeting summary for all users
- **1 General Action Items View**: Complete list of all tasks for all speakers
- **N Speaker-Specific Views**: Personalized action items for each meeting participant
- **UI Behavior**:
  - "Your action items" when viewing user is a meeting participant
  - "Action Items" when viewing user was not in the meeting
- **Technical Implementation**: n+1 API calls with different prompts/filters

## Next Steps & Remaining Work

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration**
- **Frontend UI Development**: Build interface for meeting upload and results display
- **Speaker-Specific View Logic**: Implement "Your action items" vs "Action Items" UI switching
- **Results Display**: Show summary + appropriate action items view based on user
- **User Authentication**: Identify if viewing user was meeting participant
- **Meeting Management**: Upload, process, store, and retrieve meeting results

### **Phase 4: Production Optimization**
- **Performance**: Optimize LLM token usage and API response times
- **Scaling**: Handle multiple concurrent meeting processing requests
- **Cost Management**: Monitor and optimize OpenAI API usage costs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints and data handling

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features**
- **Meeting Analytics**: Trends, patterns, and insights across meetings
- **Integration**: Connect with existing Notion workspaces
- **Advanced AI**: More sophisticated action item tracking and follow-ups
- **Multi-format Support**: Video, different audio formats, real-time processing

## Current Status: Phase 3 COMPLETE ✅
**Ready for Integration Testing**: Complete end-to-end application with:
- ✅ Backend pipeline with AI analysis and speaker-specific views
- ✅ Frontend interface with recording, upload, and results display
- ⏳ Frontend-backend integration testing needed

## Backend Issues Discovered During Frontend Development
_(No backend fixes attempted per frontend-first approach)_

1. **CORS Configuration**: Backend may need CORS headers for frontend API calls
2. **File Upload Limits**: Default request size limits may be too small for meeting recordings
3. **Processing Timeouts**: Long-running meeting processing may exceed default timeout limits
4. **Voice Sample Handling**: Backend expects specific voice sample field names (voice_sample_1/2/3)
5. **Error Response Format**: Frontend expects consistent error message structure
6. **Status Monitoring**: No real-time processing status endpoint available
7. **Session Management**: Backend has no session/user context for speaker matching

## Frontend Architecture Notes
- **Two-section layout** implemented as specified
- **Session-only persistence** (no database dependency)
- **MediaRecorder API** for cross-browser audio recording
- **Speaker-specific action items** logic based on participant matching
- **Error boundary** and comprehensive error handling throughout
- **API service layer** ready for backend integration
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS utilities
