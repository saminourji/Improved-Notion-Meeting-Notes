# Progress Log – Improved Notion Meeting Notes Prototype

_This is a living document intended to be updated alongside development. Use it to capture newly discovered tasks, track progress, and record feedback-driven changes._

## Usage Guidelines
- Update this document whenever a task is started, completed, or reprioritized.
- Capture notable feedback from demo reviewers and translate it into actionable items below.
- Link to relevant commits, pull requests, or logs when available.

## Snapshot Status
- **Overall State:** Planning & scoping
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 – Backend Pipeline (pre-implementation)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-22

## Active Action Items
- [x] Finalize recommended speech/LLM tech stack selections based on current research
- [ ] Define backend project structure, environment setup, and configuration strategy
- [ ] Implement voice profile ingestion endpoints (upload + mic capture placeholders)
- [ ] Prototype speaker embedding generation and storage workflow using sample voices
- [ ] Integrate diarization pipeline and validate against provided conversation audio
- [ ] Set up transcription service (e.g., Whisper) and transcript annotation formatting
- [ ] Design LLM prompts for summaries and persona-specific action items
- [ ] Draft REST API contract for frontend consumption (profiles, meetings, artifacts)
- [ ] Establish logging format and file rotation strategy for pipeline stages

## Completed Work
- Documented backend setup and automation brief (docs/backend-setup.md, docs/backend-agent-brief.md).

## Blockers & Risks
- Verify OpenAI usage costs and rate limits against expected demo traffic.
- Potential compute constraints for diarization/transcription on chosen hosting provider.

## Feedback & Notes
- _Placeholder for insights from demo runs, Notion engineers, or user testing._

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Adopted stack documented in `docs/technical-stack.md` (pyannote.audio + faster-whisper + OpenAI API).
- TODO: Document setup instructions for Hugging Face token, FFmpeg, and OpenAI API keys in README.
- TODO: Build CLI smoke test to validate pipeline once scaffolding is ready.

## Upcoming Milestones
- Phase 1 kickoff: backend scaffolding ready for initial pipeline tests
- Phase 2 readiness: REST APIs proven with sample data and documented for frontend handoff
